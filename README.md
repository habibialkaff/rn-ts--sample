# rn-ts--sample
This is a sample React Native build using ["Create React Native App"](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/VERSIONS.md).

The app uses:
* ["TypeScript"](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking. 
* ["React Navigation"](https://reactnavigation.org/) for routing.
* ["Redux"](http://redux.js.org/) for state management.

This app has nested navigation: Tab Navigation inside Stack Navigation.

It also uses ["HOC"](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/higher-order-components.html) concept to restrict access for some Screens.

### How to use
Make sure to run "npm run dev" while running "npm start" so that the typescript is compiled everytime a TS/TSX file is changed.
